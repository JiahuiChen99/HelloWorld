#### **ðŸ’» Linux Kernel Modules (1st Project)**
> Knowledge of `C programming` language is a must since it's the only supported for kernel programming. Support for Kernel development with Rust is still in its early stages.

The first project is intended for the students to gain knowledge and learn the differences between the **Kernel context**, and the **User context**.
Creation of 2 Linux Kernel Modules.
The first one acts as character device where the client can interact with the kernel space.
Reading from the character device this will reply with a default message.

The second module is a USB module where students will have to solder a small PCB with 4 push buttons and 2 LEDs.

##### **Material**
- 1x PCB / Protoboard
- 4x buttons
- 6x resistors ( 220Î© ~ 1kÎ© )
- 8x Male pin header
- 8x cables
